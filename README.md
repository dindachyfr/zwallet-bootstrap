## Z Wallet Slicing Content

This repository contains slicing codes from the Zwallet mockup which can be accessed at the following [link](https://www.figma.com/file/YddmKtK1PafpeyUkeSyIiq/Zwallet---Client%3A-Arkademy?node-id=0%3A1).

I put each page on Zwallet at separated folders based on its name, in which contains images, html, and its stylesheet. The responsive design is using media queries for maximum width of 480px. In designing responsive web for mobile, iPhoneX is used as reference, for it is commonly used nowadays.
